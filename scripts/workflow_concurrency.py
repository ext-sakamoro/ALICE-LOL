"""Every workflow run by a push to a branch has a top-level `concurrency` group that
cancels superseded runs on a branch but never a run on main (per-commit group on main).

Without one, each push to a branch queues a full run of its own and a superseded run
holds a shared runner until it finishes, delaying every other run in the account.
A workflow whose push trigger names only tags (a release) is exempt, as is one with
no push trigger. Fails when such a workflow lacks the key, and when no workflow was read.
